/**
 * Runs `run` whenever `deps` change, owning the loading flag, the AbortSignal,
 * and the staleness bookkeeping that keeps a superseded response from landing.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT own the data. `run` writes whatever state the caller
 * already has, because several call sites do real work with the response beyond
 * storing it — DownloadsCard steps back a page when the current one overshoots,
 * useSprites preloads an image, AuthContext runs a retry loop. If this hook
 * returned `data`, every one of those would need an effect watching it, which
 * is how you re-create the react-hooks/set-state-in-effect findings this whole
 * refactor exists to remove.
 *
 * ## Call-site convention: do not pass an inline `async` callback
 *
 * `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` is registered against this hook (see
 * `additionalHooks` in eslint.config.mjs) so it validates the `deps` array,
 * which is the only thing keeping a hand-written dep list honest. The cost is
 * that it treats `run` like a useEffect callback and rejects an inline `async`
 * arrow ("Effect callbacks are synchronous to prevent race conditions").
 *
 * Both of these are fine, and cover every call site:
 *
 *   const load = useCallback(async (signal) => { ... }, [a, b])
 *   useFetchEffect(load, [load])                       // named async, by reference
 *   useFetchEffect((signal) => fetchX(a, signal).then(setRows), [a])   // non-async arrow
