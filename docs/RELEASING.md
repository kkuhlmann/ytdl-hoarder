# Releasing

Maintainer runbook. End users don't need this — see [README.md](../README.md) to install.

**A `v*` tag is the release.** Pushing one builds that exact commit, publishes the image under the
matching version tags, and opens a GitHub Release page for it. There are two ways to create that
tag, and they end in the same place.

## How the pieces fit

A **git tag** is a pointer to a commit. A **GitHub Release** is a page wrapped around a tag — title,
notes, a "Latest" badge.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` listens for `push: tags: ["v*"]`. Both routes produce that event:

- **Terminal** — `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`. The workflow builds, then creates the
  Release page with auto-generated notes.
- **Web UI** — publishing a Release creates the tag, which fires the same workflow. It builds, sees
  the release already exists, and leaves your hand-written notes alone.

## Cutting a release

**Pre-flight**

1. CI is green on `main`.
2. `backend/pyproject.toml` `version` and `frontend/package.json` `version` match the version you're
   about to tag, minus the `v`. Nothing enforces this — it's on you.

**From a terminal**

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git tag v0.1.0            # keep the leading v; the workflow matches on it
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The **Actions** tab shows a `Release` run. It takes a while — the arm64 leg builds under emulation.
When it finishes, the image is on GHCR and `/releases` has a `v0.1.0` page with a changelog built
from the PRs merged since the previous tag.

To tag something other than the tip of `main`, name the commit: `git tag v0.1.0 <sha>`.

**From the web UI** (use this when you want to write the notes yourself)

1. Repo → **Releases** (right sidebar, or `/releases`) → **Draft a new release**.
2. **Choose a tag** → type the new tag, e.g. `v0.1.0` → click **+ Create new tag: v0.1.0 on
   publish**. Keep the leading `v`.
3. **Target**: `main` (or a specific commit).
4. Title: the version, e.g. `v0.1.0`.
5. **Generate release notes** for the same changelog the terminal route produces, then edit freely.
6. Leave **Set as a pre-release** unchecked. Keep **Set as the latest release** checked.
7. **Publish release**. The tag is created at this point, which is what starts the build.

## What gets published

Tag `v0.1.0` produces one multi-arch manifest (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64) under six references:

```
v0.1.0   0.1.0   v0.1   0.1   latest   sha-<short>
```

All six point at the same digest. The `v` and bare forms both exist because the docs and `setup.sh`
name the `v` form while Docker convention is the bare one.

### Two different "latest", and they are unrelated

| | Set by | Means |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub **Latest** badge | the checkbox in the release form; automatic by version/date for a tag-push release | which release the `/releases/latest` page shows |
| Docker tag **`latest`** | metadata-action's `latest=auto` flavor | what `docker pull …:latest` resolves to |

Neither influences the other. `latest=auto` is why `release.yml` lists no explicit `latest` rule —
see the comment there before changing it.

### The `latest` footgun

`latest=auto` tags any non-prerelease semver release as `latest` **without comparing it to existing
versions**. Releasing a hotfix on an older line — `v0.1.5` after `v0.2.0` already shipped — moves
the Docker `latest` tag *backwards* onto older code, and `latest` is what `setup.sh` installs by
default. If that situation comes up, publish the hotfix as a pre-release, or re-run the workflow
against the newest tag afterwards to put `latest` back.

### Pre-releases

A hyphen in the tag is semver's prerelease marker, so `v0.2.0-rc.1` is one automatically: the
workflow marks the Release page as a pre-release, and metadata-action emits only the full version
(`v0.2.0-rc.1`, `0.2.0-rc.1`) — no `latest`, and no floating `v0.2`/`0.2`. From the UI, tick **Set
as a pre-release** as well.

## Verifying a release

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/kkuhlmann/ytdl-hoarder:v0.1.0
```

Expect a manifest list with `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` children, plus `unknown/unknown` entries
(those are the provenance attestations, not a problem). `:0.1.0` and `:latest` must report the same
digest.

Then exercise the documented pin path in a scratch directory: set `YTDL_HOARDER_TAG=v0.1.0` in
`.env` and run `docker compose -f docker-compose.published.yml pull`.

Both commands must work while logged out, since `setup.sh`'s default published-install path pulls
anonymously. A `denied` means the package visibility has reverted to private (GitHub → Packages →
`ytdl-hoarder` → Package settings → Change visibility) — that switch is separate from the
repository's own.

## Fixing a botched release

Delete the Release *and* its tag, fix the problem, then re-tag the same version. GHCR overwrites an
existing image tag without complaint, and the workflow only skips release creation when a release
still exists — so deleting both is what makes the retry behave like a first attempt.

```bash
gh release delete v0.1.0 --cleanup-tag    # or delete both in the UI
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0         # if the tag survived
git tag -d v0.1.0
```

**Do not** clean up GHCR with `actions/delete-package-versions` and `delete-only-untagged-versions`.
In a manifest list the per-arch children are themselves untagged package versions — only the index
carries the tag — so that sweep deletes the amd64/arm64 images out from under a working tag and
pulls start failing with `manifest unknown`. The retention note at the bottom of `release.yml` has
the detail.

## `workflow_dispatch`

Actions → Release → **Run workflow** builds from a branch. It pushes `<branch>` and `sha-<short>`
only — never `latest`, since there's no semver tag involved. Useful as a dry run of the build, or
for a one-off image, but it is not a release.

## If the repo moves

`release.yml` derives the image name from `${{ github.repository }}` and follows a move on its own.
`ghcr.io/kkuhlmann/ytdl-hoarder` is hardcoded elsewhere and does not: `setup.sh`,
`docker-compose.published.yml`, `.env.sample`, and several files under `docs/`. Sweep for the
string before the first release from a new repo.
