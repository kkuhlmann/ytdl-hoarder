"""In-process sliding-window rate limiting for the unauthenticated auth endpoints.

Keyed on client address alone, never on the submitted username. A per-username counter
would let anyone lock a chosen account out of its own sign-in, and would reintroduce the
enumeration oracle that /forgot-password and /admin-recovery/request are written to avoid:
identical response bodies stop telling you whether an account exists, but a per-username
budget starts telling you again.

The limit is charged before the handler runs, so it is reached at the same rate whether or
not the username exists, and a caller flooding these routes never reaches the bcrypt
comparison that makes them expensive to serve.
