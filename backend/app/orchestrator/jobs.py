"""Job specifications and the name → definition registry.

A JobDefinition describes *how* a kind of job runs (which function, which lane,
which lifecycle hooks, which retry policy). A JobSpec describes *one* enqueued
job (its task_id, args, priority). The registry lets startup recovery and the
retry scheduler re-materialize jobs from bare TaskRecord rows.
