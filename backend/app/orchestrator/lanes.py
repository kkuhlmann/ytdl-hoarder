"""Execution lanes: named queues with a configurable width and priority ordering.

- default       (orchestration work; defaults to 2)
- subscriptions (channel/playlist enumeration; defaults to 1)
- downloads     (downloads; defaults to 1)
- ml            (transcription/clips/sprites; defaults to 1)

Widths come from the app_settings row and are editable live in the Settings UI
(see set_concurrency).

Subscription pipelines get their own lane because one holds its slot for an
entire channel enumeration plus a per-video DB check, and priority cannot
preempt a *running* job — on the default lane the two cron job types could
occupy both slots and stall manual downloads for minutes.

Entries are popped in (priority ASC, queue_sequence ASC) order — the same
ordering the UI reconstructs from TaskRecord. Equal keys dequeue in submission
order: pop_next uses min(), which returns the first minimal element of an
append-ordered list. Untracked jobs all tie at queue_sequence None (+inf), so
that tie-break is what orders them.

Thread-safety model: all queue mutations happen on the event-loop thread
(submissions from worker threads are marshalled via call_soon_threadsafe),
so plain lists need no locks. Dispatchers wait on an asyncio.Event.
