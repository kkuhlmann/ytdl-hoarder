# Job bodies for the orchestrator, re-exported for convenient imports.
# Registration with the orchestrator happens once at app startup via
# register_all_jobs() (see tasks/registry.py).
#
# NOTE: tasks.transcription is deliberately NOT imported here — it is resolved
# lazily inside the spawned ML child (orchestrator.child_main), keeping
# faster-whisper out of the main process entirely.
