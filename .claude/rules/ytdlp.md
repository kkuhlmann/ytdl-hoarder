# yt-dlp configuration

Root `AGENTS.md` carries the Deno requirement and the "defaults live in `models.py`" rule. For a
download that is failing right now — empty files, 403s, `Signature solving failed`, a video stuck as
not-yet-released — use the `yt-dlp-diagnostics` skill, which goes deeper than this file.

Browser impersonation and player-client settings avoid YouTube blocking:
- Random impersonation via `curl-cffi` (`ytdlp/options.py`); player-client fallback order set in the Settings UI (default `['visionos', 'tv_simply', 'web_safari', 'web', 'web_embedded']`)
- **Challenge solving**: yt-dlp ≥2025.11.12 needs an external JS runtime for YouTube `sig`/`n` challenges — **Deno ≥2.3.0** (auto-discovered from PATH) plus the `yt-dlp-ejs` dep. Deno is pinned via the `DENO_VERSION` ARG in `Dockerfile.prod`; too-old Deno → `Signature solving failed` → `Requested format is not available`
- Defaults live in `models.py` (`DEFAULT_PLAYER_CLIENTS` / `DEFAULT_COOKIES_PLAYER_CLIENTS`) and **only affect a fresh `app_settings` row** — existing installs keep stored values, so change them via the Settings UI, or ship a data migration as `realign_player_clients` does. Watch for clients yt-dlp removes upstream (e.g. `tv_embedded`) *and* for ones it keeps but demotes: `android_vr` still exists, but YouTube 403s every format it returns as of 2026-08-17, so a stored list still leading with it silently caps downloads at whatever the next client offers
- Downloads failing with empty files usually means yt-dlp needs updating or the player clients need adjusting
- **Throttling is three separate knobs, all `app_settings` columns (never `config.yml`), all 0 = off.**
  `download_sleep_seconds` sleeps *between* jobs and only for subscription/playlist ones
  (`_rate_limit_sleep` returns early otherwise). `download_rate_limit_kbps` → yt-dlp `ratelimit`,
  applied per job body, so it multiplies with `downloads_lane_concurrency` exactly like the sleep does.
  `request_sleep_seconds` → yt-dlp `sleep_interval_requests`, and it is deliberately set in **both**
  option builders — it is paid in `_request_webpage` during *extraction*, so downloads-only would miss
  the channel walks and populate fetches that are most of the request volume. `ratelimit` conversely
  stays out of `ytdlp/info.py`: metadata extraction has no media transfer to cap. `_throttling_options`
  (`ytdlp/options.py`) exists because inlining the two branches pushed `create_ydl_options` past ruff's
  C901 limit.
- **`_get_pot_extractor_args` deliberately emits two keys.** yt-dlp derives a POT provider's
  extractor-arg key from its *class* name (`pot/_provider.py` `PROVIDER_KEY` →
  `youtubepot-{key.lower()}`), so the CLI provider reads `youtubepot-bgutilcli:cli_path`. The
  second key, `youtubepot-bgutilscript:script_path`, is not a leftover: bgutil's HTTP provider reads
  it directly to decide whether a refused connection to its `127.0.0.1:4416` server is expected.
  Drop it and every extraction gains a warning. Unrecognised `youtubepot-*` keys are silently
  ignored, so neither mistake announces itself.
- **The cookie file is never handed to yt-dlp directly.** `YoutubeDL.close()` truncates and rewrites
  `cookiefile`, with no locking, and lanes run concurrently in one process — so a job that started
  earlier can overwrite a rotated session cookie a later job already persisted, and a run killed
  mid-close leaves a half-written file. `ytdlp/cookies.py`'s `cookie_session` is the single place that
  decides whether cookies apply *and* hands out a disposable copy. It is also the only place that
  knows metadata extraction has no attempt counter, so `RETRIES_ONLY` means never for it.
- **Impersonation is randomized only for anonymous requests.** `_get_impersonate_headers` keeps the
  extractor's per-client User-Agent, so an impersonated request pairs a browser TLS fingerprint with
  a smart-TV or Android-VR UA. Spread across anonymous requests that is cover; under one authenticated
  account a fingerprint that moves every job is a repeating mismatch, so `create_ydl_options` pins
  `get_stable_impersonate_target()` whenever `cookie_file` is set.
- **`DENO_VERSION` and `BGUTIL_POT_VERSION` are watched by a workflow, not by Dependabot.** Both are
  fetched by `curl` inside a `RUN`, and Dependabot's `docker` manager only parses `FROM` /
  `COPY --from` — so neither appears in `.github/dependabot.yml` and neither can. `Dockerfile.prod`
  must keep both as `ARG NAME=value` on their own line: `.github/workflows/pinned-release-check.yml`
  greps for exactly that, and its bump `sed` is anchored on the `=` so the bare re-declarations inside
  the builder stage keep inheriting. Do not "simplify" either pin back to `releases/latest` — that
  layer sits after the `uv.lock` COPY, so `latest` makes the PO-token provider update as a side
  effect of any Python dependency bump.
