# Orchestrator and task-body internals

Deep detail for `backend/app/orchestrator/` and `backend/app/tasks/`. The lane list, priority ladder,
pipeline diagrams and feature summary live in the root `AGENTS.md`.

## `tasks/media.py` — the deferral rules

**`tasks/media.py` — the deferral rules.** Unreleased videos get a visible NOT_READY placeholder
TaskRecord (upserted per URL at populate time, soft-deleted and replaced by a QUEUED chain once the
video airs). "Unreleased" = live or upcoming premiere, or a finished livestream still flagged
`post_live` **whose VOD formats aren't available yet** — yt-dlp can keep `post_live` set for hours
or days after a downloadable VOD exists, so `is_video_ready_for_download` (`ytdlp/info.py`) allows
post-live once real formats are present.

**A deferral also persists a `NOT_READY` `MediaDetails` row** (`_defer_media`) carrying the expected
`release_timestamp` and a `next_check_at`, because the TaskRecord placeholder alone is invisible to
the subscription filter — which keys on `MediaDetails`, so without the row every premiere and every
unavailable video is re-fetched on *every* tick forever. `next_check_at` is a known future premiere
time, else an age-keyed ladder; `_evaluate_not_ready_media` honours it, except for direct downloads,
which always bypass the backoff. Two ladders: a short one for unreleased videos, a much longer one
for videos yt-dlp *positively* reports as gone. `get_url_info` swallows every failure into a `None`,
so `get_url_info_with_failure` + `classify_extraction_error` decide which — and the long ladder is
opt-in by whitelist, since a 429 or bot-check is otherwise indistinguishable from a private video and
parking a rate-limited channel for a week is the worse error.

**Three places must never accept a deferred row as resolved**, or an unreleased video downloads early
using its premiere metadata: the reuse branch and the pre-fetched-metadata shortcut in
`_use_pending_or_fetch_fresh` (both bypass the yt-dlp fetch, hence the readiness check —
`_reuse_or_delete_existing_media` blocks both at once), and the upsert on the way back out. Deferred
rows are updated in place, never delete-and-recreated like SKIPPED: the delete would reset
`created_at`, which the ladder reads. Clearing needs the explicit `sync_clear_deferral` because
`_copy_upsert_fields` refuses to write `status` when it is `NONE`.

## Resizing a lane

Three constraints on resizing:
- **A shrink is necessarily lazy.** Surplus permits are held by *running* jobs and reclaiming one
  would mean killing its job, so `set_concurrency` only retargets and the dispatcher retires permits
  via `absorb_surplus_permit` as jobs finish. `Lane.capacity` (in the `/tasks/runtime` snapshot) is
  what's actually in circulation and trails `concurrency` until then. When `absorb_surplus_permit`
  returns True the dispatcher must neither dispatch nor release — releasing would undo the shrink.
- **`set_lane_concurrency` is event-loop-thread only**, like every other queue mutation. The settings
  router is `async`, so it already is.
- **`downloads` above 1 changes what `download_sleep_seconds` means** — the sleep is per job body, so
  it stops pacing the deployment as a whole. `ml` above 1 runs a faster-whisper child per job, each
  sized by `transcription.whisper_cpu_threads`. Both are bounded to 1–8 server-side.

## Retargeting the cron cadence

**The cron cadence is retargeted live, and that needs `CronJob.schedule_token`.** `cron_loop`
recomputes a fire time only *after* firing, so a change from 60 to 5 would otherwise sit unapplied
until the top of the hour. `IntervalSchedule.version` bumps on a real change and
`refresh_stale_schedules` replaces the pending fire time — before the due-time check, so a retarget
displaces the pending fire rather than racing it. `next_fire_every_n_minutes` anchors its slots on
**midnight, not the hour**, which is what lets a value above 60 mean what it says; the hour-anchored
version silently collapsed everything above 60 to hourly.

## Subscription fan-out throttling

**The fan-out crosses a lane boundary, and that is the whole reason it needs throttling.** A lane
comes from the `JobDefinition`, not the submitting job (`JobSpec` has no `lane` field;
`_submit_nowait` resolves it via `get_job_definition`), so the pipeline holds the single
`subscriptions` slot while every `POPULATE_JOB` it emits lands on `DEFAULT_LANE`. A large channel
would otherwise park thousands of untracked, in-memory-only jobs there — a spike a restart silently
loses.

`_wait_for_fanout_capacity` (`tasks/subscriptions.py`) instead blocks the producer on
`orch.queued_count(DEFAULT_LANE)`, bounding peak depth without capping throughput (the lane still
drains at its own rate; we top it up). Safe to run long because `_fire_cron_job` submits with a fixed
`task_id` and `_submit_nowait` ignores a resubmit whose task_id is already queued or running — a long
pipeline suppresses its own overlapping ticks. `FANOUT_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS` bails if the default lane
wedges, losslessly: the next tick re-enumerates.

Throttle the producer, never the cycle. A pre-enumeration backlog guard that skips the whole tick
throws away a completed channel walk and stalls every *other* subscription for the duration of a
drain.

## The RESOLVING placeholder

Resolution is slow enough to look like a hang — a yt-dlp metadata fetch, a whole
playlist enumeration for `download_playlist`, and a wait behind `DEFAULT_LANE`'s
width — so a submission must be visible before populate finishes. `POST /ytdl/`
writes the download `TaskRecord` up front in `RESOLVING`, titled with the raw URL,
and the chain **adopts that row** rather than minting its own, so the task_id the
user is watching never changes.

Four things the code can't state:

- **The placeholder task_id must never be a `JobSpec.task_id`.** The chain is dispatched
  from *inside* the still-running populate job, so `_submit_nowait`'s idempotence guard
  (`core.py`) would see that id already in `_handles` and silently drop the download. It
  travels as payload data (`DownloadJobDTO.placeholder_task_id`), which is also why
  cancellation is cooperative — `orch.cancel` has nothing to dequeue, so `revoke_task`
  writes `CANCELLED` and `_adopt_placeholder` reads it and stands down.
- **`RESOLVING` is in `ix_task_records_active_unique`'s predicate but *not* in
  `ACTIVE_DOWNLOAD_STATUSES`.** The index gives double-submits the same DB-level dedup
  every other active status gets; staying out of the status list keeps
  `_find_duplicate_active_tasks` blind to the chain's *own* placeholder, which would
  otherwise make it stand down against itself.
- **`guard_resolving_placeholders` wraps *outside* `retry_transient_db`** (see
  `registry.py`). It is the guarantee that no submission is stranded in `RESOLVING` —
  every early return and raise lands in its `finally`, and `sync_retire_placeholder`
  no-ops unless the row is still `RESOLVING`. Inside the retry wrapper it would retire
  the row between attempts, and the retry would find nothing to adopt.
- **The guard is only for a body that owns the row to resolution.** `POPULATE_JOB` does —
  it adopts or writes a specific outcome before returning. `DIRECT_DOWNLOAD_PIPELINE_JOB`
  does *not*: it hands each row to a populate job and returns while that job is still
  queued, so a blanket retire-on-exit kills every chain it just started (silently — the
  chain stands down on the non-`RESOLVING` row and `SKIPPED` is not in the default Tasks
  filter). It is therefore registered unguarded and tracks a `unclaimed` set of task_ids
  in `run_direct_download_pipeline`, discarding each on hand-off and retiring the rest in
  a `finally`. Compare by id *value*: `expand_playlists_impl` round-trips every job
  through `serialize_download_job`, so the dict submitted is never the one that arrived.
  That `finally` is also why the retry moved *inside* the body, onto
  `_fan_out_download_chains` — the ordering rule above still applies.
- **Per-video placeholders are created *after* `filter_completed_downloads_impl`**, so a
  500-video playlist where 480 are already downloaded surfaces 20 rows, not 500 that
  instantly flip to SKIPPED. The rule: a placeholder exists for every URL the user
  explicitly named, plus every video that survives playlist filtering.

Startup recovery resumes these from `TaskRecord.pending_payload`, which is what keeps a
restart mid-resolution from losing the download with no trace: both the pipeline and
populate jobs are `tracked=False`, so the persisted payload is the only record of them.

## Lifecycle hooks (`orchestrator/hooks.py`, run by `orchestrator/wrapper.py`)

`BaseStatusHooks` (status writes + SSE) · `DownloadHooks` (live-row re-resolution, NOT_READY-preserving
success guard, downstream failure marking, cancel file cleanup) · `TranscriptHooks` / `ClipHooks` /
`SpriteHooks` (cleanup of partial transcripts / clip files / truncated sprite sheets `on_cancel`).

## Sprite generation

Runs on the `ml` lane as a tracked `SPRITE_GENERATION` task (`SPR` in the Tasks UI). The row is
created at **populate time** by `_persist_download_chain_state`, alongside the download and transcript
rows (VIDEO only), and dispatched later. **The visible SPR row is the point**: the transcript behind
it sits `QUEUED`, and without a row holding the slot that wait looked like a hang.

Four constraints the code can't state:
- **`queue_sequence` is the "dispatched yet?" marker.** The chain row is inserted with it NULL, which
  is what `crud.py`'s queue-position pass and startup recovery both key on — recovery must leave a
  QUEUED sprite alone while `_upstream_still_pending`, or it tiles a file that isn't on disk yet. The
  retry path re-arms a sprite row by clearing it back to NULL.
- **Dispatch lives in `DownloadHooks.on_success`, not the job body**, because that fires for exactly
  the right outcomes: normal success plus the repeat-download and file-already-exists paths (which
  have a file on disk), but not superseded/quota (`SkipJob`, no hooks) or not-ready (returns early on
  the NOT_READY retval). It is the last statement in the hook, so a raise — absorbed by
  `wrapper._run_hook` — costs only the sheet. Moving it back into the body loses all of that.
  Sprites still beat the transcript to the lane, since `core.py` enqueues `spec.downstream` only
  after `run_job_sync` returns.
- **Sprite rows set `download_job_url`**, so `ix_task_records_active_unique` dedups the automatic and
  manual paths for free. But that index counts `CANCELLED` as active, so a cancelled row must be
  retired before inserting (status → `DELETED`; setting `deleted_at` alone does **not** free the slot
  — the predicate has no `deleted_at` clause). Scope of a cancel: **within one chain it sticks** (the
  hook must not silently recreate the row, or the cancel button is a visible no-op), **a new download
  chain wipes the slate**, and **the manual Generate button always wins** (`revive_cancelled=True`).
- **ffmpeg cannot report progress on this pipeline.** `tile` buffers every frame and emits one packet
  at EOF, and `-progress`'s counters track the first output stream — the sheet. Measured on a 30-min
  video: one progress block, at the end; `split` + a second probe output (`null`, `rawvideo`,
  `mpegts`) all still gave one. Only a two-stage pipeline (frames to a temp dir, then tile) yields a
  real percentage. Hence the elapsed-time ticker via `run_ffmpeg_cancellable`'s `on_tick` — don't
  "fix" it by reaching for `-progress` again.

**`mark_downstream_stmt` sweeps every downstream task type by default**, which is what makes a
cancelled or failed download take its whole chain with it. The one exception is the pair of
download-skip paths (repeat download / file already exists): they must end the transcript *without*
touching the sibling sprite row that `on_success` is about to dispatch, hence
`sync_skip_downstream_transcripts` and the `task_types` filter. Both paths must write *something*:
`ctx.skip_downstream` only suppresses the in-memory enqueue, so a path that writes nothing strands
the transcript at `QUEUED` forever.
